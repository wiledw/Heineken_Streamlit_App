Average number of shares

HEINEKEN has 576,002,613 shares in issue. In the 2020 basic EPS calculation, the weighted average number of
shares outstanding was 575,625,598 (31 December 2019: 573,643,551).

In the calculation of 2020 diluted EPS (beia), shares to be delivered under the employee incentive programme
(196,007 shares) are added to the weighted average shares outstanding. The weighted average diluted number
of shares outstanding was 575,821,605 (2019: 574,217,111). In the calculation of diluted EPS on IFRS measures,
shares to be delivered under the employee incentive programme are excluded as these have an anti-dilutive
impact given the reported net loss.

Total dividend for 2020

The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2020,
payment of a total cash dividend of €0.70 per share, representing a decrease of 58.3% (2019: €1.68), will be
proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 22 April 2021 (“2021 AGM’). The payout ratio was set at 34.9% in
the middle of the range of our policy. If approved, the full dividend will be paid on 6 May 2021, as no interim
dividend was paid during 2020. The payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax. Due to the
reported net loss in 2020, the proposed dividend will be paid out of the equity reserves. The ex-dividend date
for Heineken NV. shares will be 26 April 2021.
